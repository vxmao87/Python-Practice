It was a cold but normal day, one that would live on to be the most interesting I've ever encountered. Snow never really occurred as often as you'd think here in our city, so when it does happen, we never really know how to handle it. Cars skidded and bumped into each other like dominoes that you've placed so delicately, waiting for the chance to knock that first one down. Snow weighed over everyone's roofs, lowering the temperature of the households inside and forcing heat conditioning to blast nonstop. Finally, dangerous sections of black ice began to form under the blanket of snow, waiting for unsuspecting folk to cause laughs from neighbors or do damage to our bones. With all this said, snow in our area is quite omnipotent; it can shut our city down in an instant. We have ways of working around this, however. And for that, we are an indefatigable bunch.
